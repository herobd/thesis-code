    <!--
    <p>Thank you for volunteering your time. This is an experiment to characterize how fast and accurate people are at using the CATTSS app. It should take about 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>You will begin by being briefly trained and then will complete a series of tasks.</p>

    -->
    <p>Thank you for your time!</p>
    <p>This study is to collect information regarding how long it takes people to complete the individual tasks, as well as how accurately they perform them. There are 3 sessions in this segment. Please do each individual session in an uninturrpted sitting, otherwise the timing collection will be inaccurate.</p>
    <p>You will be alerted when you're finished with a session. If not automatically redirected, use <b>menu -> exit </b> to return here when finished with a session.</p>

        <h2>Session 1: full system</h2>
        <% if (id && id.length>0) { %>
        <p>You will work in this mode for about 14 minutes.</p>
        <p>If you are unfamiliar with the system, take the training option.</p>
        <p>There are keyboard controls to speed things up, using the arrow keys:<br>
        -Left/Right: label spotting as incorrect/correct<br>
        -Up: Skip instance<br>
        -Down: Undo<br>
        (these can be seen again in the menu)
        </p>
    <!--
        <p>The interface for approving spottings is changed in this version. You will be presented with a cluster and, after identifying outliers, classify the cluster as a whole as correct or incorrect.</p>
        <p>I don't have a training series for this one, so instread view <a href=??>this training video</a> before begining.</p>

        <h2>Session 3: manual lines</h2>
        <p>You will work in this mode for about 4 minutes. You will be manually transcribing lines, as opposed to words. (Transcribe what's highlighted, sometimes it only covers a partial line. That's just a ground truth error.)</p>

<h2>How CATTSS works</h2> 
<p>The system begins by looking for common letter combinations (subwords) like 'th' or 'er'. It can't do this very well by itself, so it passes subwords it is unsure about on to users.</p>
<p>When the computer has a few letters filled in for a word (think of the game "Wheel of Fortune" - some letters are known, some are blank), it creates a list of possible transcriptions for that word. If this list is reasonably small it passes it to a user to select the correct one.</p>
